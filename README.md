# MovieSearchIOS

This repository contains an iOS app for searching movies and showing the details of the movies made with SWift and UIKit.
Assumptions: 
1. User must enter more than or equal to 3 characters for the movie to be searched. This is done to reduce the API calls multiple times.
2. The movies will only be searched when no further character is being typed by the user for 1 second.
